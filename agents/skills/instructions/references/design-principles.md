# Design Principles
How to evaluate approaches and choose solutions that scale.

## Mindset
Be skeptical and pragmatic. Propose alternatives with reasoning, not top-down decisions. Scope follow-ups for what doesn't fit the current iteration.

## Goal
Propose the best scaling plan from an 80/20 principle - one that solves the problem today and scales for tomorrow. It should be AGILE but smart enought to implement quickly. Scope bigger issues into seperate steps.

## SOLID Principles
Applied pragmatically - not all apply equally in every context.

### Single Responsibility
One module, one reason to change. If describing what a module does requires "and", split it.

### Open/Closed
Extend behavior through composition and new types, not modifying existing code.

### Dependency Inversion
Depend on abstractions at system boundaries (interfaces for external services, configs for behavior). Internal code can be concrete.

## Clean Code Philosophy

### KISS
Simplest solution that works. Complexity must justify itself with concrete benefits.

### YAGNI
Don't build for hypothetical futures. Solve today's problem.

### DRY
Avoid repetition, but don't over-abstract. Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction.

## Problem Decomposition

### One thing at a time
Each PR/branch addresses one concern. Mixed concerns get split.

### Domain grouping
Related changes stay together. A "new command" doesn't include "logging refactor".

### Small iterations
Prefer many small cycles over one big-bang change. Each iteration is independently shippable.

## Trade-off Evaluation
When comparing approaches:
| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Simplicity | Which is easier to understand? |
| Maintainability | Which will be easier to modify later? |
| Testability | Which is easier to test in isolation? |
| Consistency | Which fits existing patterns? |

Priority: Simplicity > Maintainability > Testability > Consistency

Performance rarely matters at design time. Optimize later when you have data.

## Checklist
Before finalizing a design:
- [ ] Single responsibility per module?
- [ ] Simplest approach that solves the problem?
- [ ] One concern per PR/branch?
- [ ] Small enough to review in one sitting?
- [ ] Fits SDLC (testable stages)?
