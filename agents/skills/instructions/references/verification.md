# Verification

**MANDATORY: Run before every PR/commit**

## Quick Check

Run all applicable checks before committing:

```bash
# TBD - will be defined once tech stack is chosen
# Expected: format + lint + test
```

## Requirements

- All tests must pass
- No linter warnings
- Code formatted per project standards
- PR must pass CI before merge

## Tech Stack Note

Verification commands will be defined once the tech stack is decided. This file should be updated as part of the first implementation cycle.
