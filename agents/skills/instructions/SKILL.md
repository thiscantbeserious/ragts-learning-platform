description: Project-specific development instructions. Use whenver instructions are mentioned. Auto-Load when working on tasks like coding, testing, git operations, or exploring the codebase. Read the matching file from references/.

## 1. Access pattern

Before taking action, check if a reference file matches by name (e.g., git → git.md) or by task type (e.g., writing code → tdd.md). Read it first.

## 2. Required before writing code

- `tdd.md` - test-driven development cycle for new implementation
- `coding-principles.md` - coding principles when modifying or writing code

## 3. Load as required by task

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Git operations | `git.md` |
| Running commands | `commands.md` |
| Before commit/PR | `verification.md` |
| Understanding codebase | `project.md` |
| State file management | `state.md` |
| SDLC process | `sdlc.md` |

## 4. Templates

State file templates are in `templates/`.
